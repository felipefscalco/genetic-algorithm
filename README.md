# Genetic Algorithm implementation
The genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions.

This was a really fun college project for an AI class, a 10x10 maze with the paths defined was given to be built, with one entrance and one way out, the goal was to implement a genetic algorithm which could find the maze solution.

With the default parameters it can take up to 20~40 generations to find the maze path.

You will be able to check the previous generations information by clicking on the generation number on the right panel.
